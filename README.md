# Sample project to practice MERN using Typescript

**Goal**
I'm going to attempt to create the 'TechNotes' project from Dave Gray's tutorial entirely in Typescript.

Dave Gray's tutorial deploys full stack to Render.com, so I will deploy that way first.
-- THEN, MAYBE --
I'll also deploy the front end to Netlify.

I'm going to buy a domain name on Hostinger and point that to the deployed app.
