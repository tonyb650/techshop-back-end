# Sample project to practice MERN using Typescript

**Goal**\
This backend is a mash-up of two follow-alongs (see below). The goal was to compare different implementations of a NodeJS/Express server and also translate JS code to Typescript. Also deployed this backend to Render.com to work through the deployment process and get some practice with that.
